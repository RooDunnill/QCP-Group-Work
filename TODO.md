Coding:
  Implement Shannon and Von Neumann entropy functions for the qubits
  potentially make the density matrix a part of the class as self
  find a neat way to encorporate the density matrices more generally and a way to make mixed states
  produce a sorter to find the outcomes of grovers
  continue on Shors algorithm if people want to
  optimise the tensor product (matmul) and the matrix multiplication (mul)

Department division:
  coding/programming part- Roo, Hayden, Sean (bridge)
  report/physics part- Siddhi, Gayathri, Boren (bridge)

Plan of action for week-5:
  optimising and improving Grovers algorithm,
  background study on Shors algorithm,
  meeting with Tony,
  continue onto cryptography if we want to
